DEMO: http://jakke-korpelainen.github.io/newtab-react

#Briefly
Developed for personal use. Decided to remake with React the one I made previously with Angular.
I've built it with gulp and hosted it in node. 

#Features
Customizable! Though the theme-option in settings currently does nothing. App refreshes the forecast every minute and rotates the backgrounds in every 7.5 seconds.
Backgrounds used are hosted in Cloudinary CDN.

	npm install
	gulp browserify
